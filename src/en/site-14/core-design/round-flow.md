# Round Flow

## Early Game
Analogy: starting up the bus.
Research
Looking at the site agenda and deciding what tasks should be dealt with
Testing on LCZ anomalies should begin
Preparation for HCZ anomaly tests should begin
Security
Guards should be split between HCZ and LCZ with gear distributed accordingly
Guards should take up their positions
Help out scientists with initial tests by escorting D Class
Cargo
Figuring out roles, taking early orders and getting to the Distribution Site
Maintenance
Prepare containment chambers for testing where needed by Research
Medical
Get a good chemical supply
Start helping out Research
Minutemen
Get situated and deploy to first expeditions
D Class
Get used on SCP 9711-S where needed but mostly CHILLIN
Notes
If mode is GOI raid, the raiders preparation will begin now
During infiltration roles will be revealed to agents

## Mid Game
Analogy: the wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round (but on a bumpy road)
Research
Should be prototyping first gear as well as descending deep into trees at this point
HCZ test prep should be finishing up so testing on those can begin
SCPs should be getting cycled through testing
SCP 9711-S should be getting used if it is wanted
Test on new SCPs from Minutemen
Security
Deal with minor breaches in LCZ and possibly HCZ
Monitor checkpoints and continue previous duties
Cargo
Should be in full swing
Maintenance
Should be in full swing
Medical
Start producing anomalous meds
Start identifying corpses/D classes affected by anomalies
Minutemen
Start bringing SCPs back
D Class
Small riots should break out at this point, or more orchestrated riots


## Late Game
Analogy: the bus is on fire, blown up, hurtling down a mountain side, with a nuclear bomb in the back, covered in bullet holes and cognitohazards (or its an agenda completion, and everything is fine and it gets to its destination)
Research
Fully disbanded and fighting for survival, using remaining points to develop weapons and gear for that reason
Security
Remaining as connected as possible and dealing with breaches where they can
Cargo
If on station join research, if off site await retrieval
Maintenance
Keeping the power and essential systems alive
Medical
If medbay is functional, ensuring it stays that way. If not setting up a field hospital
Minutemen
Assisting Security
D Class
Either breaking out of just dead
Notes
If nothing bad happens, orders for all continue as normal for midgame, until the agenda is complete, or other round end conditions are met.
